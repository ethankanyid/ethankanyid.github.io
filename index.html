                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a senior Computer Science student at Washington
                            State University, graduating in Spring 2026 and
                            specializing in cybersecurity. Currently, I
                            contribute to secure infrastructure at Pacific
                            Northwest National Laboratory by developing data
                            workflows with Python, SQL, and Apache Airflow. I
                            have a strong foundation in low-level computing,
                            including C/C++ and Linux systems, and maintain a
                            3.95 GPA. Additionally, I actively participate in
                            national cybersecurity competitions to sharpen my
                            skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am self-motivated and value family, teamwork, and
                            meaningful personal connections. I earned my
                            Associate’s degree from Columbia Basin College while
                            still in high school and took a gap year to attend
                            Legacy Bible Institute. This experience led to a
                            life-changing opportunity to work with over 1,400
                            youth at Life Song for Orphans in Zambia.
